# Fragrance Scraper

A comprehensive tool for scraping fragrance information from Fragrantica.com using parallel processing for high performance.

## Project Overview

This project allows you to collect detailed information about fragrances from Fragrantica.com, including:

- Fragrance name and brand
- Gender and release year
- Ratings and review counts
- Main accords
- Perfumer information
- Notes (top, middle, base)
- Longevity and sillage
- Descriptions and images

The scraper uses a multi-threaded approach to collect data efficiently while respecting Fragrantica's servers.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on macOS 11+)
- Python 3.9+

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmattyV/fragrance-scrape.git
cd fragrance-scrape
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Conda Environment

```bash
# Install Miniconda if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install miniconda
conda init zsh  # Or bash if you use bash

# Create and activate the environment
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate Aroma
```

### Step 3: Install Additional Python Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up SmartProxy

The scraper uses cloudscraper with SmartProxy to bypass anti-scraping protections:

1. Sign up for a SmartProxy account
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
```
SMARTPROXY_USERNAME=your_username
SMARTPROXY_PASSWORD=your_password
SMARTPROXY_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
```

### Step 5: Create the Control File

Create a file named `control.txt` in the project root directory with the content `run`:

```bash
echo "run" > control.txt
```

## How It Works

The project consists of two main scripts:

### 1. `generate_links.py`: Collect Fragrance URLs

This script collects brand and perfume URLs from Fragrantica.com:

```bash
python generate_links.py
```

#### Checkpointing in `generate_links.py`:

The script uses several text files for checkpointing to allow for resuming the process if interrupted:

- **fra_brand_links.txt**: Stores all brand URLs scraped from Fragrantica
  - If this file exists and has content, the script skips scraping brand links
  - Used to avoid re-downloading brand URLs on subsequent runs
  
- **success_brands_urls.txt**: Tracks which brand URLs have been successfully processed
  - Used to skip already processed brands when restarting the script
  - Each brand URL is added to this file after its perfume links are successfully extracted
  
- **failed_brand_urls.txt**: Tracks which brand URLs failed to process
  - The script will skip these failed URLs on subsequent runs
  - Useful for tracking problematic URLs for manual inspection
  
- **fra_per_links.txt**: Stores all collected perfume URLs
  - Each newly discovered perfume URL is appended to this file
  - The script maintains a set of existing URLs to avoid duplicates
  - This file is the primary output used by `fra_scraper.py`

### 2. `fra_scraper.py`: Extract Fragrance Data

This script processes the perfume URLs to extract detailed information:

```bash
python fra_scraper.py
```

#### Checkpointing in `fra_scraper.py`:

The script uses several files for checkpointing and control:

- **fra_per_links.txt**: Input file containing all perfume URLs to process
  - Generated by `generate_links.py`
  - Each line contains a single perfume URL
  
- **data/fragrance_data.csv**: Stores the scraped fragrance data
  - The script checks this file to determine which URLs have already been processed
  - It extracts the URL field from each row to create a set of processed URLs
  - New fragrances are only appended to avoid duplicate work
  
- **failed_urls.txt**: Tracks perfume URLs that failed to process
  - Used to avoid retrying problematic URLs
  - Useful for debugging or manual processing later
  
- **control.txt**: Controls the scraper's operation
  - `run`: Normal operation (default)
  - `pause`: Temporarily pause scraping (will resume when changed back to `run`)
  - `abort`: Stop the scraper completely
  - The script checks this file periodically, allowing for controlled stopping/pausing

## Running the Scripts

### Step 1: Generate Fragrance Links

First, collect all the fragrance URLs:

```bash
python generate_links.py
```

This will:
- Create and populate `fra_brand_links.txt` (if it doesn't exist or is empty)
- Process each brand page to extract perfume links
- Save new perfume links to `fra_per_links.txt`
- Track progress in `success_brands_urls.txt` and `failed_brand_urls.txt`

The script is designed to resume from where it left off if interrupted.

### Step 2: Run a Test Scrape (Optional)

Before scraping all fragrances, verify your setup with a small sample:

```bash
python test_scraper.py
```

This will scrape a small sample (5 fragrances) and create `data/test_fragrances.csv`.

### Step 3: Run the Full Scraper

Once testing is successful, run the main scraper:

```bash
python fra_scraper.py
```

This will:
- Read all URLs from `fra_per_links.txt`
- Skip URLs already in `data/fragrance_data.csv` and `failed_urls.txt`
- Process each URL to extract fragrance information
- Save results to `data/fragrance_data.csv`
- Track failed URLs in `failed_urls.txt`
- Monitor `control.txt` for commands

## Controlling the Scraper

You can control the scraping process through the `control.txt` file:

- Set to `run` for normal operation
- Set to `pause` to temporarily pause (will resume when changed back to `run`)
- Set to `abort` to stop completely

This allows you to pause or stop the scraper without losing progress.

## Understanding the Output

The generated CSV file includes the following fields:

- **Name**: Fragrance name
- **Brand**: Brand name
- **Gender**: Target gender (men, women, unisex)
- **Year**: Release year
- **Rating Value**: Average user rating
- **Rating Count**: Number of ratings
- **Main Accords**: Primary fragrance accords
- **Perfumers**: Names of perfumers
- **Top Notes**: Initial scent notes
- **Middle Notes**: Heart notes
- **Base Notes**: Base notes
- **Longevity**: How long the fragrance lasts
- **Sillage**: How far the fragrance projects
- **Description**: Full description of the fragrance
- **Image URL**: URL to the fragrance image
- **URL**: Link to the fragrance page

## Troubleshooting

- **SmartProxy issues**: If you encounter connection problems:
  - Verify your SmartProxy credentials in the `.env` file
  - Check your SmartProxy account status and quota
  - Try adjusting the request timeout values in the scripts

- **Rate limiting**: If you encounter rate limiting, edit the scripts to adjust:
  - Batch sizes (reduce the number of URLs processed in parallel)
  - Delays between requests (increase the sleep times)
  
- **Interrupted process**: If either script is interrupted, you can simply run it again:
  - Both scripts use checkpoint files to resume where they left off
  - No need to delete any files or modify anything
