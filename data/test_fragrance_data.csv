Bond No.9 High Line High Line is anew fragrance by Bond No.9 presented in an irresistible flacon decorated with leaves of grass and charming floral buds. It was inspired by the newest park of New York, which now has a fragrance dedicated to its existence. The fragrance was created by Laurice Rahme, founder of the house of Bond No.9, and it is based on herbal and floral cultures found in High Line Park. High Line is a former rail raised 30 meters above ground, stretching between Gansevoort and 34th Street. Only the first phase of the park has been finished so far, north to 20th Street; second part is scheduled for 2011, while the third part is still negotiated about. In 1999 there was still a risk of tearing down the huge pontoon. Joshua David and Robert Hammond united with the Mayer Michael Bloomberg's administration and founded Friends of the High Line. Design of the garden was created by Dutch landscape designer Piet Oudols, with an aim to connect ecology and design. The park was designed to be rustic and natural. Plants of domestic origin which bloom during whole year were chosen and crops were planted so that blossoming plants change colours and looks of the park depending on the season. High Line is, as Laurice Rahme says, the first 'railroad' fragrance by Bond No.9 – a unisex edition constructed as marine-aldehydic-green fragrance. The aim of IFF perfumer Laurent Le Guernec was to capture prairie wildness and beauty of leaves while combining them with urban poetry of railway and strict colours of surrounding industrial buildings. As for river, Guernec added ozone notes with surrounding structural metals represented by aldehydes. The biggest part of the formula arrives from floral-green assortment of the park – purple love grass and Indian rhubarb are united with bergamot in a top. Red leaf rose, tulip and grape hyacinth were used in a heart, combined with orange flower water. The High Line’s bur oak hides in a base. Laurent le Guernec says the following about the High Line composition created of 11 notes: ''It is a very fun floral, in a very modern, industrial way.' The fragrance arrives on the market in March 2010 and its assortment includes 50 and 100 ml EDT. Laurice Rahme joined Friends of High Line association and she will donate 4% of profit from the perfume for facilitating needs of the park.",https://fimgs.net/mdimg/perfume/375x500.7503.jpg,https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Bond-No-9/High-Line-7503.html
